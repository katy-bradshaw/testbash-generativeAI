## Pre-requisiites

- playwright

## Getting Started

- `npm install playwright` for the first time or just `npm install` there after.

## Running the tests

- cd into the `playwright` folder
- Run `npx playright test` (Note that the dependendencies aren't automatically installed at runtime, so if you run this command from there you will need to manaually install the dependencies)

## Additional Information

Having a folder for the tests helps to keep the repo clean and easy to navigate.
